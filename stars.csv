The headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery.

"guilhermeferreira/spikepp","SPIKE is a protocol fuzzer creation kit. It provides an API that allows a user to create their own fuzzers for network based protocols using the C++ programming language. The tool defines a number of primitives that it makes available to C coders, which allows it to construct fuzzed messages called “SPIKES” that can be sent to a network service to hopefully induce errors. SPIKE was specifically designed to focus on finding exploitable bugs, so it’s an excellent choice for our purposes.  SPIKE also includes a simple scripting capability, and within the SPIKE distribution, there are a few command line tools which can act as interpreters to simple text files containing SPIKE primitives.","C","",,70,23,"","https://github.com/guilhermeferreira/spikepp",3,"spikepp","guilhermeferreira","https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/410343?v=4","2017-03-07T18:01:00Z","2022-03-29T10:07:39Z","2023-08-06T18:08:32Z","2017-03-10T23:33:05Z",false,false

"KasperskyLab/TinyCheck","TinyCheck allows you to easily capture network communications from a smartphone or any device which can be associated to a Wi-Fi access point in order to quickly analyze them. This can be used to check if any suspect or malicious communication is outgoing from a smartphone, by using heuristics or specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). In order to make it working, you need a computer with a Debian-like operating system and two Wi-Fi interfaces. The best choice is to use a Raspberry Pi (2+) a Wi-Fi dongle and a small touch screen. This tiny configuration (for less than $50) allows you to tap any Wi-Fi device, anywhere.","Python","","Apache License 2.0",2863,204,,"https://github.com/KasperskyLab/TinyCheck",41,"TinyCheck","KasperskyLab","https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20599646?v=4","2020-11-23T16:25:11Z","2020-12-27T16:53:47Z","2023-08-11T03:08:45Z","2023-06-26T11:04:11Z",false,false
