"korczis/foremost","Foremost is a console program to recover files based on their headers, footers, and internal data structures. This process is commonly referred to as data carving. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery.  Originally developed by the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations and The Center for Information Systems Security Studies and Research , foremost has been opened to the general public.

Whether accomplished by phishing emails, delivering a payload through an exploit, or social engineering, running code on target computers is part of most penetration tests. That means that you will need to be able to bypass antivirus software or other host-based protection for successful exploitation.

"guilhermeferreira/spikepp","SPIKE is a protocol fuzzer creation kit. It provides an API that allows a user to create their own fuzzers for network based protocols using the C++ programming language. The tool defines a number of primitives that it makes available to C coders, which allows it to construct fuzzed messages called “SPIKES” that can be sent to a network service to hopefully induce errors. SPIKE was specifically designed to focus on finding exploitable bugs, so it’s an excellent choice for our purposes.  SPIKE also includes a simple scripting capability, and within the SPIKE distribution, there are a few command line tools which can act as interpreters to simple text files containing SPIKE primitives.","C","",,70,23,"","https://github.com/guilhermeferreira/spikepp",3,"spikepp","guilhermeferreira","https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/410343?v=4","2017-03-07T18:01:00Z","2022-03-29T10:07:39Z","2023-08-06T18:08:32Z","2017-03-10T23:33:05Z",false,false
